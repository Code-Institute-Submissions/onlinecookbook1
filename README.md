Anthony Keogh: student in code institute - full stack development.
onlinecookbook is the name of my project which you are able to add and store recipes


Objective of project from code institute to CREATE AN ONLINE COOKBOOK that has the following features:
•	Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes
•	Put some effort into designing a database schema based on recipes, and any other related properties and entities (e.g. views, upvotes, ingredients, recipe authors, allergens, author’s country of origin, cuisine etc…). Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between them, and use either foreign keys (in the case of a relational database) or nesting (in the case of a document store) to connect these pieces of data
•	Create the backend code and frontend form to allow users to add new recipes to the site (at least a basic one, if you haven’t taken the frontend course)
•	Create the backend code to group and summarise the recipes on the site, based on their attributes such as cuisine, country of origin, allergens, ingredients, etc. and a frontend page to show this summary, and make the categories clickable to drill down into a filtered view based on that category. This frontend page can be as simple or as complex as you’d like; you can use a Python library such as matplotlib, or a JS library such as d3/dc (that you learned about if you took the frontend modules) for visualisation
•	Create the backend code to retrieve a list of recipes, filtered based on various criteria (e.g. allergens, cuisine, etc…) and order them based on some reasonable aspect (e.g. number of views or upvotes). Create a frontend page to display these, and to show some summary statistics around the list (e.g. number of matching recipes, number of new recipes. Optionally, add support for pagination, when the number of results is large
•	Create a detailed view for each recipes, that would just show all attributes for that recipe, and the full preparation instructions
•	Allow for editing and deleting of the recipe records, either on separate pages, or built into the list/detail pages
•	Optionally, you may choose to add basic user registration and authentication to the site. This can as simple as adding a username field to the recipe creation form, without a password (for this project only, this is not expected to be secure)




          Onlinecookbook is a website that is visually stunning while also simplistic in terms of ease of navigation. I designed it for the generation that are over 25, specifally late 30's to early 40's age group because that is the age bracket that browse online for recipes the most.
         This age dont like complex website because of family and work time and if there user experience is not good or they spend a lot of time navigating then there is good chance they will go off the website quickly.
         I used very little words in the frontpage, just short, sweet and straight to the point. The images i used for the homepage are stunning and work well with the headings and buttons. 
         I decided not to design a footer at the bottom because every thing i want users to see is already there, and a footer would serve not purpose for my website.
         The navigation to other pages is very simple and easy to use. The recipes pages are based on adding and retrieving recipes with name/description and a list of recipes below.

Components


D3.js: D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
Crossfilter.js: Crossfilter is a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. 


DC.js: is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It leverages d3 to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. Charts rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore provide instant feedback to user interaction. dc.js is an easy yet powerful javascript library for data visualization and analysis in the browser and on mobile devices.


Flask: Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.


Queue.js: Queue.js is a simple and efficient queue implementation for JavaScript whose dequeue function runs in amortised constant time. As a result, for larger queues it can be significantly faster than using arrays.


MongoDB: MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata.


JQuery:jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.

Languages
Html: Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
             
             CSS framework Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

Javascript: JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. 


Python: Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.



Testing and errors
I had problems with testing apps in pyhton and django, but the more exposure i got from fixing errors, bad syntax and just going away from code for a couple of hours and coming back fresh, that when my app testing got much better.
